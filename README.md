# Cloudflare Ai Generation

## Overview
This project is a simple web application that utilizes Cloudflare Workers for the backend and Preact for the frontend. Cloudflare Workers provide serverless compute environments that enable developers to deploy code at the edge of Cloudflare's network, closer to users, which can significantly improve performance and reduce latency. Preact, a lightweight alternative to React, is used for building fast and efficient user interfaces.

## Features
- Serverless backend powered by Cloudflare Workers
- Lightweight and efficient frontend built with Preact
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Minimalistic user interface

## Technologies Used
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/): Serverless compute platform
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/): Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the frontend
- JavaScript: Programming language used for both backend and frontend logic

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```
3. Install dependencies for frontend:
    ```bash
    cd ui
    npm install
    ```
5. Initialize wrangler and follow the setup instructions:
    ```bash
    wrangler init
